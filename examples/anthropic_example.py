Subject: Urgent: Multiple Issues with Recent Order #12345

Dear Support Team,

I'm writing to express my frustration with several issues regarding my recent order #12345 placed on December 1st:

1. DELIVERY DELAY: The order was supposed to arrive by December 5th but still hasn't shipped
2. WRONG ITEM: I ordered the blue widget but received a red one instead  
3. DAMAGED PACKAGING: The box was severely damaged and one item was broken
4. BILLING ERROR: I was charged $199 instead of the advertised $149 price
5. POOR COMMUNICATION: No one has responded to my previous 3 emails sent over the past week

This is completely unacceptable for a premium service. I've been a loyal customer for 3 years and this experience is making me reconsider my relationship with your company.

I need:
- Immediate refund for the price difference ($50)
- Replacement for the damaged item
- Expedited shipping for the correct blue widget
- Explanation for the communication breakdown
- Assurance this won't happen again

If these issues aren't resolved within 48 hours, I'll be forced to dispute the charges with my credit card company and leave negative reviews.

I hope we can resolve this quickly.

Best regards,
John Smith
