# Multi-Agent System

This directory will contain the multi-agent framework for complex email processing workflows.

## Overview

The agents system enables sophisticated email handling through collaborative AI agents, each specialized in different aspects of email processing.

## Planned Components

### Base Agent (`base_agent.py`)
- Abstract base class for all agents
- Common functionality: memory access, LLM interaction, tool usage
- Agent communication protocol
- State management and persistence

### Classifier Agent (`classifier_agent.py`)
- Specialized in email classification
- Can handle multi-label classification
- Learns from feedback and corrections
- Maintains classification confidence thresholds

### Research Agent (`research_agent.py`)
- Gathers context from multiple sources
- Searches historical emails and conversations
- Queries external knowledge bases
- Enriches email context with relevant information

### Response Agent (`response_agent.py`)
- Generates email responses
- Adapts tone and style based on context
- Handles multi-turn conversations
- Supports multiple response strategies

### Orchestrator (`orchestrator.py`)
- Coordinates multi-agent workflows
- Implements LangGraph-style state machines
- Handles agent scheduling and resource allocation
- Manages complex decision trees

## Integration Options

### LangGraph
```python
from langgraph import StateGraph, State

class EmailProcessingState(State):
    email: Email
    classification: Optional[Classification]
    context: Dict[str, Any]
    response: Optional[str]
```

### CrewAI
```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

classifier = Agent(
    role="Email Classifier",
    goal="Accurately classify incoming emails",
    tools=[classification_tool]
)
```

### AutoGen
```python
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent

assistant = AssistantAgent(
    name="email_assistant",
    system_message="You are an email processing assistant"
)
```

## Future Features

1. **Autonomous Agents**: Self-directed agents that can initiate actions
2. **Agent Collaboration**: Agents working together on complex tasks
3. **Learning Agents**: Agents that improve over time
4. **Specialized Agents**: Domain-specific agents (Legal, Medical, Technical)
5. **Agent Marketplace**: Pluggable third-party agents

## Usage Example

```python
from agents import EmailOrchestrator, AgentConfig

# Configure agents
config = AgentConfig(
    enable_research=True,
    enable_collaboration=True,
    max_iterations=5
)

# Create orchestrator
orchestrator = EmailOrchestrator(config)

# Process email with multi-agent system
result = await orchestrator.process_email(
    email=email,
    strategy="comprehensive",
    agents=["classifier", "researcher", "responder"]
)
```
